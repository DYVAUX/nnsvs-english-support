NNSVS at the time of writing doesn't support english dictionaries.
The lyrics in the MusicXML/UST files should be written phonetically.

Each syllable has it's own note.
Any pitch runs (where the pitch changes for the same syllable) will also have it's own note AND phonetic label.

The consonants should be attached to the syllable they are a part of.

Syllables can be split into it's "onset", "nucleus" and "coda".
The "onset" is the starting consonant(s) of a syllable.
The "nucleus" is the sustained vowel of a syllable.
The "coda" is the ending consonant of a syllable.

For example "sparkler" is two syllables, split into spar-kler.
These would be inserted in the XML/UST as two notes, [s p a r] [k l er].

onset	nucleus	coda	onset	nucleus	coda
[s p]	  [a]	[r]  -  [k l]	 [er]	none

Proper placement is important for the model to learn how to use consonants appropriately.
You wouldn't want the model to use a consonant meant for the start of a syllable at the end or vice versa.
