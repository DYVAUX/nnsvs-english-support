English labeling can be a daunting task for newcomers.
This document hopes to explain DynamiVox's method of labeling as clearly as possible.

Please refer to "DynamiVox English NN Phoneme Set.txt" in the base directory.
This list of phonemes will be needed during the labeling process.

During the labeling process, â€œDynamiVox Phone Ref.txt" can be used as active reference.
Please keep the notes from the full phoneme set in mind while using this reference doc.
Note that the "CMU Pronouncing Dictionary" may not be accurate reference as it uses a smaller phoneme set.
        This is mainly due to the lack of [ax] and syllabics in the CMU phoneme set.

Unlike speech, singing DOES NOT contain stress symbols. This should make labeling easier.

DynamiVox takes a "looser" approach to phonology for NN datasets.
Focusing on the intended purpose of the sound rather than the actual pronunciation.
We found this allows the labeling to be more accurate to the performance and easier to label across dialects.
The phoneme set has been adjusted accordingly, with notes provided.

Keep in mind that phonemes need to be tied to a note in the XML/UST and vice versa.
Extra of either can cause NNSVS training to fail during segmentation.
If you have multiple note to represent a "vocal run", these extra notes will require a separate vowel phoneme label.
You should also only have as many [pau] as there are Rests in your UST file.
If working with MusicXML, have only one [pau] during a resting/silent period.

Some confusion may arise when labeling allophones, syllabic consonants, and other "dialectal quirks".
Allophones are groups of sounds that fill the same phoneme.
In our case we are following the "looser" approach.
An example would be some speakers, Such as those from Scotland, using the tap [dx] (x-sampa [4]) in place of [r] in words like "street".
"street" = [s t r iy t] or [s t r iy q] ([q] is glottal stop)
Because the intended purpose of this sound is to act as an [r], it is labeled as an [r] and not [dx].
This also goes for vowels, where the shape may change based on pitch or place in the performance.

**The only exception is the "schwa" [ax] phoneme.
English is a fairly lazy language and many vowels can be replaced with a schwa at almost any time.
In these cases, always label a schwa as [ax] and not the "intended" vowel.

Keep in mind that if a sound is skipped, it should not be labeled.
For example, "next song" often drops the "t". So it would be labeled as [n eh k s][s ao ng] instead of [n eh k s t][s ao ng].

The [h] phoneme can be a bit difficult. The [h] phoneme is shaped by the following phoneme.
As an example, "when he" can sound like "whenny". It is suggested to still label the [h] phoneme in these cases, even if i s very small.

Syllabic consonants are consonants that take the role of vowels for their syllable.
These include [en], [em], and [el].
NOTE: [eng] was removed in 0.4.0 as it provided no benefit, label as [ih ng] instead.
For syllabic consonants, the consonant is sustained instead of the vowel.
the syllabic phonemes should also be used when the syllable is very short and hard to determine.
When the consonants is not syllabic, these will most likely be labeled as [ax n], [ax m], [ax l], and [ih ng].
Examples:
[en]
        button:
        "buttooooooon" [b ah t ax n]
        "buttonnnnnnn" [b ah t en]
[em]
        bottom
        "bottooooooom" [b aa t ax m]
        "bottommmmmmm" [b aa t em]
[el]
        puddle
        "pudd______le" [p ah dx ax l]
        "puddllllllle" [p ah dx el]

There are many small quirks in every dialect that need to be accounted for.
Most you may figure out without being aware of them, others will require conscious consideration.
The main goal is to account for these quirks without adding to the phoneme set.
Remember, the more phonemes you have, the more audio you will need to train those phonemes!
An example of a quirk: The flapped [n].
For some speakers, "winter" and "winner" are pronounced the same.
A flapped n is sometimes labeled as [nx], but to reduce training this is labeled as [n]
Please refer to the "flapped n US" folder for an example.

Additionally, we have the [ct] phoneme.
The [ct] phoneme is used to control "consonant closures", however the model will learn this contextually on it's own.
Instead, the [ct] phoneme is used as a toggle, to label consonants in clusters that don't match the default pronunciation.
As an example, "Kit Kat" is open said where the [t] phonemes are closures (they aren't pronounced**).
For concatenative synthesis these would be labeled as [tcl]. However, for NN this would be contextually learned.
However, if the vocalist pronounced the [t] fully (the opposite of what is expected), then you would add [ct].
The same applies to the reverse.
Do not confuse [ct] with adding a [axh] or [exh] release after some consonants.
The [ct] goes AFTER the consonant to alter it.
** some speakers use a glottal stop instead of a closure [t], this should be labeled as [q].

And as a final note, we now have the [cs] phoneme.
[cs] stands for "consonant sustain" and is for holding the silence of hard/popped consonants for an abnormally long time.
[cs] goes BEFORE the consonant to hold it's silence.
For example, if you hold the [k] in "poker" it would be labled as [p ow cs k er].
