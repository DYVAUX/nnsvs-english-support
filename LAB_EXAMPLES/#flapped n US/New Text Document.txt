It should be noted that Dynamivox English doesn't support the tapped n phoneme ([nx]) on it's own.
Instead, it will be handled contextually based on length.

For example, the word "winter" with the "t" pronounced would be:
[w ih n t er]
But with a tapped n it would be labeled as:
[w ih n er]

This means that "winner" and "winter" have the same phonetic transcription but this is fine as it will sound correct in the context of the whole phrase.

XML/UST: [w ih][n er]
