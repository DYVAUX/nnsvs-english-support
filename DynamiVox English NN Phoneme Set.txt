q	-	we-eat batten				glottal stop and vowel separator. NOT vocal fry. (we-eat, batten.)
dx	-	buTTer		shuT-up			flapped d/tt. Use in UK English is spotty.
	**NOTE: If your dialect pronounces the r in words like "straw" are "very" as a tap/flap, please still label it as [r].

ALLOPHONES:

el	-	peopLE, doubLE				vowel-like l, where l makes most of the syllable, otherwise [ax l]
em	-	bottOM *may omit			vowel-like m, where m makes most of the syllable, otherwise [ax m]
en	-	buttON	*may omit			vowel-like n, where n makes most of the syllable, otherwise [ax n]
eng	-	sING-ING, learnING			"ing" sound, where ng makes most of the syllable, otherwise [ih ng]
	NOTE: Syllabic consonants always pose timing difficulties and including these may be beneficial. Labeling depends on if the performer sustains the vowel or the consonant.
	UPDATE v0.1.6: More testing required and may not be necessary at all. [el] is being kept specifically for a sustained [l].
	UPDATE v0.1.9: Usage of these phonemes should be kept strictly for when/if the performer sustains the consonant and not the vowel (at all). These are optional.

ux	-	UNUSED FOR DNN				secondary [uw], like "dude".
nx	-	UNUSED FOR DNN				flapped/tapped [n]. (winter, winner).
	**IF IN DATASET: label dropped [t] flaps as [n t] but make the [t] very small.
axr	-	UNUSED FOR DNN				[er] with preceding schwa. Also can be thought of as reduced [er]. (diner)
ix	-	UNUSED FOR DNN				ih-esque schwa (roses, demon, planet). Use [ax] instead for these schwas.
hv	-	UNUSED FOR DNN				voiced [h] sound. Not needed for DNN as model will likely learn this on it's own.

ADDITIONAL:
pau	-	silence (default)			During unsung/silent periods.
br	-	[breath]				dude's gotta breath
exh	-	[exhale]				end breaths, end of phrase exhale.
cl	-	[closure]				silent/held consonant closures in clusters. For when closure is the exception/not normal. (invalid example: obtain) [ah b cl t ey n]
	NOTE: Unlike Japanese (which is the exception), [cl] for English/other languages closes the PREVIOUS consonant. Please keep this consistent.
cs	-	[held stop]				held stop/plosive consonant. For when the silence is held. (similar to Japanese usage of [cl] but not syllabic.
vf	-	[fry]		#			Incidental vocal fry, such as at end of phrase or between vowels. Note: refer to [_c]
	UPDATE 0.1.12: Vocal fry can happen anywhere but much more data would be needed for this to work well. Keeping as a start/end sound should require less data. Label as it appears either way.

sil	-	UNUSED					Same as pau, some use for longer silence. Wavesurfer default.

pcl	-	UNUSED		#			[cl] but specific to [p]. Don't use, requires more data and doesn't improve anything.
bcl	-	UNUSED		#			[cl] but specific to [b]. Don't use, requires more data and doesn't improve anything.
tcl	-	UNUSED		#			[cl] but specific to [t]. Don't use, requires more data and doesn't improve anything.
dcl	-	UNUSED		#			[cl] but specific to [d]. Don't use, requires more data and doesn't improve anything.

gcl	-	UNUSED		#			[cl] but specific to [g]. Don't use, requires more data and doesn't improve anything.

xx	-	UNUSED		#			Voiceless velar fricative. Scottish/Welsh specific. Incredibly rare.
							Label as [k] instead unless you want to create even more work.
